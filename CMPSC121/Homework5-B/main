//  Brief Project Description:  Ask the user to input a number between 1 and 15.
//                              Make a square of X's using that number as the
//                              length and width.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    //Initialize the variables being used
    double length, width, counter, counter2;
    
    //Ask for the size of the square
    cout << "Please enter a number between 1 and 15 (1 and 15 are valid numbers)." << endl;
    cin >> length;
    
    //Check to make sure the size is an allowed number
    while (length > 15 || length < 1)
    {
        cout << "Your number is not recognized, please enter a number between 1 and 15 (1 and 15 are valid numbers)." << endl;
        cin >> length;
    }
    
    //Set your counters being used in the loops
    counter = length;
    counter2 = length;
    width = length;
    
    //Begin the outerloop to handle how long vertically the square is
    while (counter2 > 0)
    {
        //Begin the nestedloop to handle how long horizontally the square is
        while (counter > 0)
        {
            //This displays the X's horizontally as many times as the user requested
            cout << "X";
            counter--;
        }
        //This displays the X's vertically as many times as the user requested
        //Also resets the other loop so we don't start missing X's
        cout << endl;
        counter2--;
        counter = length;
    }
    return 0;
